	<h2>{{{summary}}}</h2>
	
	<h3>Concept</h3>
	<p>Approached by <a href="http://www.vectren.com">Vectren Corporation</a>, I along with a team of <a href="http://www.iupui.edu"><abbr title="Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis">IUPUI</abbr></a> faculty and undergraduate <a href="http://informatics.iupui.edu/media/">New Media</a> students developed a comprehensive online experience to promote and educate natural gas and electricity safety to fourth-graders. In November 2009, Vectren, with the support of the <a href="http://www.nef1.org/">Natural Energy Foundation</a>, promoted this initiative called <a href="http://www.vectrenenergysafe.com">Energy Safe Kids</a> across hundreds of elementary schools in the greater Indiana-Ohio area.</p>
	<p>The project consists of three essential parts: two educational games (for both <a href="http://www.vectrenenergysafe.com/gas">natural gas</a> and <a href="http://www.vectrenenergysafe.com/electricity">electricity</a>), the <a href="http://www.vectrenenergysafe.com/">website</a> and a <a href="http://www.vectrenenergysafe.com/report-card">reporting database</a>. Professors <a href="http://newsroom.informatics.iupui.edu/directory/jludwick" rel="friend met colleague">Brian Ludwick</a>, <a href="http://newsroom.informatics.iupui.edu/directory/matapowe" rel="friend met colleague">Matt Powers</a> and <a href="http://newsroom.informatics.iupui.edu/directory/rlaranja" rel="friend met colleague">Ricardo Laranja</a> led student teams to, respec&shy;tively, tackle art direction, game development and sound design. Working with <a href="http://newsroom.informatics.iupui.edu/directory/jekstewa" rel="friend met colleague">Jennifer Stewart</a> and <a href="http://newsroom.informatics.iupui.edu/directory/rscomer" rel="friend met colleague">Skip Comer</a>, I developed and implemented the website and reporting database.</p>

	<h3>Developing the website</h3>
	<p>As an initial task, the web team designed a sitemap after organizing and analyzing various provided educational materials and static page copy. To simplify hierarchy, all pages nest no more than one layer deep and all adult-specific information is relegated to its own <a href="http://www.vectrenenergysafe.com/teachers" title="Teachers section">section</a>. Since elementary students are the primary demographic, the site tailors to children before teachers and parents.</p>
	<p>As a way to entice young readers to purposefully absorb secondary static information (beyond the primary safety content presented in the games), every page's layout is uniquely designed to fit the content.<sup>1</sup> To understand information flow in a higher fidelity, wireframes were designed for every page before committing to markup.<sup>2</sup> Afterward, a visual aesthetic and template were adapted from the color schemes and art assets provided by the art direction team. Once integrated into a <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> back-end, static pages were implemented based on the wireframes and the completed games were published.</p>

	</section>
	
	<h3>Implementing the reporting database</h3>
	<p>While informing students about the initiative in class, teachers encourage students to complete both an electricity and natural gas <a href="http://www.vectrenenergysafe.com/report-card">questionnaire</a> with their parents to self-check how well their respective households comply with safety standards. Completing this <em>report card</em> enters the student in a contest to win a desktop computer. A WordPress plugin allows Vectren to easily extract relevant information from these completed reports, highlighting potential safety concerns by state, county and school.</p>
